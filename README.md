### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kiegan! 

I am a Senior Statistician in the Statistics and Data Science Department at [NORC at the University of Chicago](https://www.norc.org/Pages/default.aspx). I am passionate about using data to better the world around me. Data-driven decision making can have a hugely positive impact on any organization, and it is even more important when those decisions can impact policy, health and well-being, and social good. I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Iowa State University in 2020, working with [Dr. Heike Hofmann](https://github.com/heike) and Dr. Ulrike Genschel. My primary research topic was computational and statistical reproducibility of data science pipelines.
